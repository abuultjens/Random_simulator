# Random_simulator
Simulates the associations of the features against random reshuffles of the target variable to generate a null distribution. This is useful for assessing how well the features associate with the actual labels compared to the expectation of random noise (make a false discovery assesment). 

# There are four scripts
ACTUAL.slurm
random_simulator_runner.sh
random_simulator.slurm
random_simulator_combiner.sh
random_simulator_plotter.py
